## Contents

This repository contains three primary analysis subfolders, which showcase three experiments conducted to illustrate the versatility of the FL4E framework in varying scenarios. 

- [**Fully Federated Experiment**](./Fully%20Federated%20Experiment)
- [**Hybrid Experiment**](./Hybrid%20Experiment)
- [**Centralized Experiment**](./Centralized%20Experiment)
- [**Local Experiment**](./Local%20Experiment)
  

## Dataset

The Genomics Data Commons portal of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides multi-modal data on various cancers. Our study focuses on the BReast CAncer study (BRCA) data, collected from 1066 patients, split into six regional clients based on the data extraction site. The goal is to predict survival outcomes, specifically death, using patients' tabular data. The prediction effectiveness is evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), accounting for data censorship.
## How to Reproduce the Analysis

1. **Run the Experiments**

    Now, navigate to each of the analysis folders and run the scripts contained within. 

    ```
    cd ./Fully Federated Experiment
    ```
    Follow the given instruction within the analysis. Repeat the above steps for `Hybrid Experiment` , `Centralized Experiment` and `Local Experiment`.
